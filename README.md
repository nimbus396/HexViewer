# HexViewer
Yet another HexViewer.

This is yet another HexViewer written in Python. This HexViewer uses Pyside6-Designer (QT) for the form. The form is loaded through the UI Loader. I wrote this just to see if I could. I liked the layout of HxD so, the simple look and feel is like it. This only loads a file for viewing. I will add functionality later.
